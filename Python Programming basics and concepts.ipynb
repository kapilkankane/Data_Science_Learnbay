    "        - **finally** block is executed anyhow even if there is error thrown in program. We can include those statements which are necessary to be executed irrespective of the program termination. *Eg. Closing file handle, socket handle, Database handle, etc.*\n",
    "    > 2. else\n",
    "        - **else** block is executed only if there is no error thrown in the program execution. We can include those statements which are necessary only to be executed if no error occurs. *Eg. Backup script execution* \n",

    "        >> - **Step 2:** Define the most likely exception at the top and less likely exception at the bottom.\n",
    "        >> - **Step 3:** Define the messages corresponding to the erroraneous situations in non technical and simple text format.\n",
    "        >> - **Step 4:** Define exception object to capture the default message.\n",
    "        >> - **Step 5:** It is good practice to define the exceptions in nested ways. Where the inner exceptions handle the specific one and outer exceptions handle the generic one.\n",
    "        >> - **Step 6:** Python provide a mechanism to group similar type/functionality based grouping of exceptions. \n",
    "        >> - **Step 7:** Define the generic default exceptions only in the outermost block.\n",
    "        >> - **Step 8:** Define the program closure statements in the outermost block to deal with those statements which are necessary to be executed just before the termination of the program.\n",
    "        >> - **Step 9:** Use ***'try'*** and ***'except'*** keywords to define the exceptions block and handle the anticipated exceptions.\n",
    "        >> - **Step 10:** Exception dealing mechanism is no going to solve the error. But, it would ensure the understanding/cause of the errors and terminate the program smoothly and accept the previous transactions which were successfully exceuted.\n",
